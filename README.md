# OrionToolkit
A self-developed collection of tools for OSINT, Reconnaissance, Exploitation, Defense, Reporting, Networking, Cryptography and Web Application Exploits. Each tool is aimed to be comprehensive and is being activity developed.

This suite of tools is ideal for penetration testers, ethical hackers, and cybersecurity professionals aiming to secure their networks, identify vulnerabilities, and enhance the overall security posture of their systems.

Below is a breakdown of the tools that will be available in the OrionSecToolkit. All ideas and thoughts on how these tools can be improved are welcome!
